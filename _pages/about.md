I am a PhD researcher in Semantic Web and Linked Data, specializing in SPARQL query optimization and RDF data analysis. With a strong background in data analysis, knowledge graphs, and SQL, I am passionate about extracting insights from complex datasets to drive decision-making.

Currently, I am transitioning from academia to industry as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist, expanding my expertise in Python, R, SQL, and machine learning. I have experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and business intelligence, and I enjoy working with structured and unstructured data to uncover meaningful patterns.

I am particularly interested in data-driven solutions, predictive analytics, and database management, and I am always eager to collaborate on projects that apply data science techniques to real-world challenges. [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
