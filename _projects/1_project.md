I worked on a project where I extracted data from **[Twitter (now X)](https://twitter.com/)** using the **[Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/)** module to analyze **public sentiment** about the **German New Year event**. The dataset consisted of tweets related to **fireworks, firecrackers,** and incidents such as **people being wounded**.

Using semantic analysis techniques, I processed and categorized the sentiment of tweets to understand public opinion on the event. This project involved:

- **Data extraction** using the **Tweepy API**
- **Text preprocessing** and **language translation** (German to English)
- **Sentiment analysis** using NLP techniques
- **Data visualization** to interpret trends and insights

This project showcases my ability to **work with social media data, perform text analysis, and visualize insights**â€”key skills in **data science and analytics**.
